# Decision Log

Compact indexed lessons and guardrails for future agents. Scan relevant entries before non-trivial or risky work, especially when the task touches a known source-of-truth boundary, migration, auth path, data flow, or quality gate.

## Entry Template

```text
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Area: short area name
Status: Active | Promoted | Superseded
Decision or mistake: what happened or what was decided
Why it mattered: the risk or outcome
Current guardrail: what future agents must do
Promoted to: durable docs or playbook rules, or None
Related docs/tests: paths or commands
```

Use `Status: Active` when the entry is still only a decision-log guardrail. Use `Status: Promoted` when the durable behavior is now represented in `docs/agent-playbook.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/README.md`, or another canonical doc. Use `Status: Superseded` only when a newer entry or canonical doc replaces the rule.

## Index

| Date | Area | Status | Guardrail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-05-01 | Docs | Promoted | Read the agent playbook for non-trivial portal work; promote durable lessons from this log into the playbook. |
| 2026-05-01 | Docs | Promoted | Do not delete active guardrail docs without confirming usage or replacing the rule. |
| 2026-05-01 | Docs | Promoted | Distinguish current-state references from active operating rules. |

## Entries

### 2026-05-01 - Docs - Agent Playbook

Area: Docs

Status: Promoted

Decision or mistake: recurring portal work needs a procedural playbook, not only an index of current-state references.

Why it mattered: future agents need a repeatable work loop for discovery, source-of-truth checks, risk routing, verification, docs maintenance, and learning from past corrections without requiring the user to intervene each time.

Current guardrail: agents should read `docs/agent-playbook.md` for non-trivial portal work. New lessons go to `docs/decision-log.md` first; only durable, repeatable behaviors should be promoted into the playbook.

Promoted to: `docs/agent-playbook.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/README.md`.

Related docs/tests: `docs/agent-playbook.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/decision-log.md`.

### 2026-05-01 - Docs - Active Guardrail Docs

Area: Docs

Status: Promoted

Decision or mistake: `docs/design-workbench-parallel-migration-rules.md` was deleted during a docs cleanup even though it was still an active workbench migration authority.

Why it mattered: the cleanup treated all long historical-looking docs as stale, but this file carried live rules for parallel workbench migration safety.

Current guardrail: before deleting any doc, check whether it is a current reference, active guardrail, operational runbook, or historical artifact. Active guardrail docs must be restored or explicitly superseded by an equivalent canonical doc.

Promoted to: `docs/agent-playbook.md`, `docs/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`.

Related docs/tests: `docs/design-workbench-parallel-migration-rules.md`, `docs/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`.

### 2026-05-01 - Docs - Current References And Operating Rules

Area: Docs

Status: Promoted

Decision or mistake: the agent docs originally optimized for current-state references but did not clearly preserve active operating rules that guide ongoing migration work.

Why it mattered: future agents need both current architecture facts and procedural guardrails from past mistakes to work safely without repeated user intervention.

Current guardrail: docs may be either `Current` references or `Active guardrail` operating rules. `docs/README.md` must label them clearly, and agents should update relevant docs whenever implementation work changes behavior, boundaries, tests, or known risks.

Promoted to: `docs/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent-playbook.md`.

Related docs/tests: `docs/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/decision-log.md`.
