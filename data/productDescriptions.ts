  // Pergolas
  pitched: `A pitched pergola extends your roofline with a clean, single‑slope canopy that sheds water reliably and keeps headroom where you need it. Built in powder‑coated aluminium, the structure stays light, straight and corrosion‑resistant with spans engineered to your wind zone. Rafters run from a higher wall plate to a lower front beam and roof sheets lock into aluminium joiners that sit on long‑run butterfly rubber running the length of each rafter for a tidy underside.

How it works: posts set on footings or a deck subframe support beams that bolt to precision brackets. A head flashing seals to the house while allowing movement. Services, lighting and blinds can be added later without re‑framing.

Why it’s good: the simple geometry suits modern homes, fits neatly under narrow eaves and moves rain off seating. With no exposed timber there’s nothing to rot or twist—rinse it down and enjoy low‑maintenance shade and shelter.

Structure & materials
• Powder‑coated aluminium beams, rafters and posts
• Roof sheets held in aluminium joiners sitting on long‑run butterfly rubber along each rafter for a clean soffit
• Engineered brackets and fixings suited to wind zone
• Integrated head/house flashing with movement allowance

Options
• Clear, opal or soft‑tint acrylic/polycarbonate roofing
• Post layouts to suit doors, sliders and paths
• LED downlights or perimeter strip lighting

FAQs
• Will it darken the room inside? Clear/opal sheets keep high daylight; add tint to cut glare.
• Can posts move off corners? Yes—offset layouts can preserve paths and doors.`,

  gable: `A gable pergola creates a peaked roof that feels tall, bright and airy. Two roof planes meet at a ridge, drawing warm air up and out while larger spans cover dining settings and sliders with ease. The aluminium frame uses deep beams for stiffness with discrete ridge/hip components that carry loads without visual clutter.

How it works: columns are set to centre the ridge; rafters and purlins lock into engineered brackets; roof sheets sit on carriers that manage drainage and movement. Translucent options maximise daylight; integrated lighting supports evening use.

Why it’s good: the symmetrical form adds street presence, handles gusty sites well and pairs beautifully with blinds and screens. You get real headroom, excellent airflow and a refined, long‑life finish.

Structure & materials
• Twin roof planes meeting at a ridge
• Powder‑coated aluminium frame with deep beams
• Engineered ridge and hip components
• Roof sheets on carriers for drainage and movement

Options

• Drop‑down blinds or fixed screens to temper wind

Performance
• Excellent headroom and perceived volume
• Natural convection via ridge for warm‑weather comfort
• Stable in gusty conditions with good structural depth
• Daylight‑rich; glare managed with tint or blinds

Recommended for
• Larger decks and sliders needing coverage
• Homes that benefit from architectural symmetry

Not ideal for
• Tight eaves where a single slope reads cleaner
• Sites with severe height limits at the house junction

Choose this if
• You want a centrepiece roofline and maximum headroom
• You value natural airflow via the ridge on warm days

Consider instead if
• You need all‑round fall and corner wind control (see Hip)
• Height at the house is very constrained (see Pitched)

FAQs
• Is a gable too bright? Use opal/tint to balance light and glare.
• Can I keep views through the gable? Yes—open or clear infills maintain outlook.`,

  hip: `A hip pergola pitches down on all sides so the roof wraps the space neatly and manages wind at the corners. It integrates naturally with complex rooflines and reads like built‑in architecture. Frames are powder‑coated aluminium with concealed brackets for crisp hip lines and a clean soffit.

How it works: a central ridge and diagonal hips transfer loads to perimeter beams and posts; custom flashings step roof sheets around the hips while maintaining drainage. Posts can offset to suit doors and paths.

Why it’s good: multi‑direction fall sheds rain without splash zones, wind eddies are reduced and the silhouette looks premium without fuss. It’s strong, recyclable and made to withstand New Zealand sun and salt.

Structure & materials
• Four‑sided roof with ridge and hip beams
• Powder‑coated aluminium frame and posts
• Concealed brackets for clean lines
• Custom flashings around hips to manage water

Options

• Premium architectural silhouette with tidy soffit
• Strong weathering for coastal NZ environments

Recommended for
• Complex façades and corner decks
• Sites exposed to changeable wind directions

Not ideal for
• Narrow spaces where a single pitch saves height

Choose this if
• You want the most composed silhouette and balanced drainage
• You need better corner wind behaviour than a single pitch

Consider instead if
• You prefer a central ridge and taller feel (see Gable)
• You have very tight height constraints (see Pitched)

• Can it meet complex walls/flashings? Yes—custom flashings step sheets cleanly around hips.`,

  // Screens & walls
  'slat-screens': `Slat screens introduce privacy and wind tempering while keeping decks open and breathable. Panels are built on rigid aluminium frames and fixed with adjustable brackets between posts or pergola beams. Choose warm timber for natural texture or powder‑coated aluminium for a sharp, low‑maintenance look—the mounting method is the same.

How it works: slats run vertically or horizontally at a pitch that’s tuned to outlook and sun path. Mixed layouts can use denser lower portions with lighter uppers to stop draughts without darkening the space. Matching gates and service panels use the same profiles so utilities disappear into the design.

Why it’s good: you get human‑scale boundaries that soften views, hide bins and heat pumps and cut glare—without building heavy walls. Timber ages gracefully when maintained; aluminium keeps lines crisp with a quick washdown.

Structure & materials
• Aluminium perimeter frame with adjustable brackets
• Timber or aluminium slats in several profiles
• Durable exterior finishes and fixings

Options
• Vertical or horizontal orientation; mixed density layouts
• Integrated gate or removable service panel
• Colour‑matched powder coat; timber oil/stain systems

Performance
• Cuts wind and glare while retaining airflow
• Privacy control without heavy walls
• Durable, low‑maintenance aluminium option available

Recommended for
• Screening neighbours, bins and heat pumps
• Defining edges of an outdoor room

Not ideal for
• Full weather blocking—choose acrylic panels or blinds instead

Choose this if
• You want filtered privacy and softer wind without losing air movement
• You like timber texture or a fully colour‑matched aluminium solution

Consider instead if

FAQs
• Will slats rattle? Profiles and fixings are selected to avoid noise.
• Can I mix timber and aluminium? Yes—frames are compatible with both.`,

  'acrylic-infill-panels': `Acrylic infill panels add year‑round usability by blocking wind and rain while preserving views. Clear or softly tinted sheets slot into slim aluminium channels with gasket isolation so they stay quiet and allow for thermal movement. Panels can be fixed, removable or configured to slide depending on exposure.

How it works: impact‑resistant acrylic is cut to size and captured in sealed frames; discreet mullions control deflection; optional vent trims keep air moving where needed.

Why it’s good: you gain shoulder‑season comfort without the weight, cost or permanence of full glazing. Light transmission remains high, cleaning is simple and the result feels integrated with the pergola.

Structure & materials
• Clear or tinted acrylic sheets in aluminium frames
• Gasket isolation for quiet, stress‑free mounting
• Discreet mullions sized to exposure and spans

Options
• Fixed, removable or sliding panel configurations
• Tint choices to balance privacy and heat
• Trickle vents for air movement where required

Performance
• Significant wind and rain protection
• High light transmission; manageable glare with tint
• Lighter and more economical than full glazing

FAQs
• Will panels yellow? Quality acrylic resists UV; clean with neutral pH soap.
• Can I remove panels seasonally? Removable and sliding options are available.`,

  'drop-down-blinds': `Drop‑down blinds give on‑demand control of wind and low sun. Fabrics range from clear PVC for weather blocking to open‑weave meshes that cut glare while keeping the view. Blinds run in side channels or stainless guides to stay steady in gusts.

How it works: a manual crank or motorised tube rolls the fabric into a compact headbox; side channels capture the edges and a weighted bottom bar seals to the deck. Motors can integrate with remotes, wall switches and wind sensors to protect the blind automatically.

Why it’s good: tune comfort instantly without permanent walls. The components colour‑match the pergola for a built‑in look and fabrics are replaceable down the track.

Structure & materials
• Extruded aluminium headboxes, side channels or cable guides
