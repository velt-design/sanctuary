          All Sanctuary Pergolas structures are backed by a 10-year warranty covering workmanship
          and structural integrity. In the unlikely event of a leak, defect, or performance issue,
          our team remains available long after installation is complete and will typically attend
          site within one week to assess and resolve the matter. We stand behind every project we
          build and take pride in providing ongoing support, ensuring your pergola continues to
          perform as intended for years to come.
